## Glad to see you here! 👋

I'm a pre-final year BTech (ECE) student at NIT Nagaland, driven by a deep curiosity for emerging technologies. My fascination with computers began back in school when I first encountered a basic programming class, where I was amazed by how lines of code could bring ideas to life. Today, I’m diving into AI Agents, LLM integrations, and Data Science, and I’m excited to explore new opportunities to grow in the Data Science field.

## Things I like to do ✨

- Love experimenting with AI agents, LLMs, and real-time systems — feels like bringing ideas to life.
- Enjoy digging into data to find patterns and build smart, useful stuff.
- Outside tech, I’m into long walks, vibing with friends, sparking spontaneous tech chats, playing cricket, unwinding with music, and exploring curious thoughts.

## 🙋‍♂️ About Me

- 🚀 I'm a curious mind at the intersection of Data Science, AI Agents, and LLM-Oriented Architectures
- 🧠 Currently exploring how Model Context Protocol (MCP) and context-aware systems shape intelligent workflows
- 🤖 I build projects that blend Machine Learning, autonomous agents, and real-time decision pipelines
- 🤝 Always up for collaborations that push the edge of predictive analytics and agent-driven automation
- 😄 Pronouns: he/him
- ⚡ Fun Fact: I get oddly excited when agents start behaving like tiny problem-solvers — especially if they’re streamlining healthcare or fixing broken data workflows at 2 AM.
